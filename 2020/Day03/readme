Part One:
    Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?

Part Two:
    Determine the number of trees you would encounter if, for each of the following slopes, you start at the top-left corner and traverse the map all the way to the bottom:

    Right 1, down 1.
    Right 3, down 1. (This is the slope you already checked.)
    Right 5, down 1.
    Right 7, down 1.
    Right 1, down 2.
